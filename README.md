## Description

I have added demo with table and cards. However I have gone with cards approach in final code. We can improve deesign further as well. 
- For the front end I have used Angular and boot strap for this demo (Angular material can be other option for this).
- Ceated 3 different components for listing, filter and toggle.
- API calls have been made through serivces using dependency injection
- Environment files used for API key and URL.

In demo I have added some extra records to show pagination. For the final code I have prefer card approach.
